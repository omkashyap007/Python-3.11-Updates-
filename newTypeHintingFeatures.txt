Type hinting : 

type hinting tells that what type of variable function , or variable accepts and what type of object 
a varibale is . 

with 3.11  you can define python type hints :: 

a : int = 10
b : dict[int , str] = {"number" : 10  }

def function(username : str) :
    print("This way you can tell what type of object function accepts ")

also this is useful for ai or the code editor for the suggestions . 
this feature was in previous versions , but this has become lot better . 

if you define the type hint , you will get suggestions as you hit tab 

example : 
def function(name : str) :
    name.<tab>
    isalpha()
    isalnum()
    all the suggestions will be given . 

for type hinting on more advance level , we do have typing module .
import typing
